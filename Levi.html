<img src="Assets/levi.jpg" alt="Levi Croker" title="Levi Croker">

<p> My name is Levi Croker. My date of birth is the 28<sup>th</sup> February, 1994. I currently
live at 10A Tucville Terrace. I grew up with my mom and grandmother. As I grew up, I attended various
schools, like Head Start Nursery as a toddler, Smith Memorial Primary School as a child, and East Ruimveldt 
East Ruimveldt Secondary and Government Technical Institute as a teen. I'm currently attending the University 
of Guyana, pursuing studies in Computer Science. <br><br>

&nbsp I am a proud Seventh Day Adventist Christian, a strong believer in the Bible. We believe in the 
Sabbath, a day set aside by God for rest from all earthly works and the weekly stresses. We also look forward and prepare
for the gospel of the second coming of Christ.<br><br>

&nbsp My hobbies includes reading, story writing, and gaming. I have an interest in working with computers. My 
goal in life is someday gain a career in the line of computing and contribute effectively to society. </p>
